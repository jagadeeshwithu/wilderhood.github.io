<p>Kabini – A name that has gained popularity world-over for wildlife lovers. A name that is associated with huge herds of elephants (700+ elephants have been seen on a single evening a few years ago). A name that brings images of charismatic tigers. And of stealthy leopards on trees. And the majestic tiger walking through his realm. Kabini is all this…and a lot more. </p>

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/2015-02-07/tigernlandscape.jpg" alt="ESSENCE OF KABINI - Every place has a signature photograph to it. For me, this is the closest it comes for Kabini. The banks of the reservoir, with fresh grass growing at the onset of summer. The beautiful moist deciduous forest all around it. And the majestic animals that define the place - the Tiger and the Elephant.">

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/2015-02-07/Leopard-walking-on-the-track.jpg" alt="TRAFFIC JAM - Sound advice it was. For predators abound here. On a warm March afternoon, this stunner decided to lead the way. And we were more than glad to oblige.">

<p>I’ve visited this magical forest many times, including a few weeks that I spent on assignment in summer 2014.  This portfolio is a collection of photographs that showcases the variety of wildlife and habitats that this rich forest holds. Enjoy the virtual safari! </p>

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/2015-02-07/Egret-reflections.jpg" alt="REFLECTION - The moment I saw the dried bamboo reflections in the Kabini reservoir, my mind was made - I had to make a photograph with that as the background. It wasn't until 2 days (and 4 safaris) later that I finally got the opportunity when this Great Egret decided to cross the waters.">

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/2015-02-07/Elephants.jpg" alt="SYMMETRY - In summers, huge herds of elephants congregate on the banks of the Kabini Reservoir. It is a spectacle that is unparalleled in India. They come from forests all around to feast on the fresh green grass. Here two of them (probably mother and calf) seem to be enjoying an evening meal, while posing symmetrically.">

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/2015-02-07/Leopard-on-tree.jpg" alt="LEOPARD-ON-TREE - This one decided to spend the afternoon on a fallen tree. One often comes across Leopards resting on trees here, probably to keep themselves safe from the one predator that can vanquish them.">

<p>About Kabini - The forest is officially called Nagarhole National Park or Rajiv Gandhi National Park. This Project Tiger Reserve is also part of the larger Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve (that encompasses Bandipur, Mudumalai and Wayanad as well). The name Kabini comes from the river that flows through the park. The Kabini River Lodge (run by Jungle Lodges and Resorts) is located on the banks of the Kabini reservoir. Formerly a private hunting lodge of the Mysore Maharaja, this place has gone through the cycle from being a shikar hotspot to an example of wildlife conservation and organized tourism.</p>

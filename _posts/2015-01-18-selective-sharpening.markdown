<p>title of the img, I clicked during my trip to Leh-Ladakh and I have to send this image for one of the galleries in photography exhibition with Darter Photography, Bangalore. IMO, I see there are details missing in monk, so I have worked with Adobe Photoshop to get only the details of monk to highlight!</p>

<p>This is one of my dream img to get as, the img <composition> says all the story about this image. My personal favourite.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Step #1</h2>
<p>Taken the original jpeg image in Photoshop and duplicated the layers, and named them 'sharpening' and 'tonemapped' to work on!</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Step #2</h2>
<p>Now, Disabled the tonemapped for now, and started working on sharpening layer. Go to Filter -> Sharpen -> Unsharp Mask. Adjusted Amount to 500% for this image, Radius I do like 4-6 Pixels, and adjusted based on the preview I like to get the details enough I tried to recover!</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Step #3</h2>
<p>Now, once the details have been retrieved enough for me, I started working on tonemapped layer. Create a layer mask, and select the 'Brush' (B) tool, (my settings here: brush size: 700px, Mode: Normal and Opacity: 100%) and start doing the brush on 'Monk' so I could get to see the sharpened image details in the front!</p>

<p>And here is the final result!!! I'm all set for my submission to the gallery</p>

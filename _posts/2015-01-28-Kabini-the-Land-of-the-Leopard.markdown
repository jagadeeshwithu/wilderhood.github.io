<p>Kabini – A name that has gained popularity world-over for wildlife lovers. A name that is associated with huge herds of elephants (700+ elephants have been seen on a single evening a few years ago). A name that brings images of charismatic tigers. And of stealthy leopards on trees. And the majestic tiger walking through his realm. Kabini is all this…and a lot more. </p>

<p>I’ve visited this magical forest many times, including a few weeks that I spent on assignment in summer 2014.  This portfolio is a collection of photographs that showcases the variety of wildlife and habitats that this rich forest holds. Enjoy the virtual safari! </p>

<p>About Kabini - The forest is officially called Nagarhole National Park or Rajiv Gandhi National Park. This Project Tiger Reserve is also part of the larger Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve (that encompasses Bandipur, Mudumalai and Wayanad as well). The name Kabini comes from the river that flows through the park. The Kabini River Lodge (run by Jungle Lodges and Resorts) is located on the banks of the Kabini reservoir. Formerly a private hunting lodge of the Mysore Maharaja, this place has gone through the cycle from being a shikar hotspot to an example of wildlife conservation and organized tourism.</p>

<p>Ladybugs aren't so cute when they're born. We may not even recognize them. They hatch from eggs and look like tiny alligators. The new bug is called a larva, and it takes about 21 days for it to grow up to be a ladybug beetle.</p>

<p>
Larva crawl out of their eggs and begin to look for food. Ladybug larvae look like tiny alligators- and they bite! After a few days the little larvae begin to grow and soon they shed their skins. This is called "molting" and it happens several times.

<p> After a couple of weeks of growing, the larvae will start to change into something that looks like a shrimp. it will attach itself to a leaf and hardly move at all.

<p>When the metamorphosis is complete ,the ladybug splits its pupa and emerges looking very different.

<p>For the first few hours the newborn ladybug remains pale and soft.

It's shell quickly hardens. Its colour becomes brighter. Now it looks just like its mother- a perfect adult ladybug beetle.
<br><br>What seems like amazing magic is one wonderful way the natural world works; ladybug metamorphosis.

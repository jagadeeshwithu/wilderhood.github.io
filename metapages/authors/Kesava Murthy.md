bio: "Kesava is probably one of the most versatile photographers you’ll meet, whose interests in the craft span across street, landscapes, sports, portraits, weddings, wildlife and macro. Rarely would you find a photographer who can do justice to so many genres. To add to his photography skills, he is a qualified naturalist and is building his specialty in arachnology and herpetology. Kesava also brings with him some of the most blessed luck in the wild. Several of our clients explicitly want him to lead our trips – they believe that if Kesava’s on the tour, action can’t be too far."

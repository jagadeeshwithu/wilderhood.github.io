bio: "I’m a Hyderabadi living in Bangalore. An IT professional and when I’m not doing IT stuff I’m spending most of my time around horses and snakes with a camera dangling from my neck. I’m passionate about horses and horse riding, and I spend most of my weekends riding horses. I also find snakes very mysterious and beautiful, and I make sure I have some jungle time every month. Generally a wildlife enthusiast, kicked about anything that has to do with conservation, wildlife or otherwise. I also love to trek and travel the world. Mighty and addictive Himalayas is my favorite place in the world. I capture my experiences through photography and writing. More here: http://mamtanaidu.com/mamta-naidu-high-on-life/"

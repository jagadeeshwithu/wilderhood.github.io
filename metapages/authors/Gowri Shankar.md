bio: "Started handling reptiles at the age of thirteen and never looked back since!!  As an animal inspector (at KARUNA, formerly BSPCA, Bangalore Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals), education officer (at the Center for Herpetology, Madras Crocodile Bank Trust, Mamalapuram Chennai), a Conservation Officer at the Agumbe Rainforest Research Station (ARRS), molded me well for his current profile as a conservationist!!!

Based at Agumbe and focus primarily on studying and conserving King Cobras. Have been staying at Agumbe for over five years and during this time had life time opportunities of observing and documenting the nesting, male combat, courtship, mating and cannibalistic behaviors of King Cobras in the wild. Also instrumental in the pioneer efforts of ARRS in conducting radio telemetry study on King Cobras.

Have worked for several wildlife documentaries behind screen, and featured along side Rom Whitaker in couple of  wildlife documentaries, ‘The King and I’,  ‘Secrets of the King Cobra ‘, ‘Asia’s Deadliest Snake’ , ‘One Million Snake Bites’ and ‘Wildest India’ by BBC, National Geographic Channel, Nat Geo Wild and Discovery channel respectively.

Apart from rescuing over hundred king cobras from distress situations I have collected vital scientific data which has led to new insights into the life of a King Cobra. Interests include in studying the ecology, breeding biology, and conservation biology of King Cobras. Also find it very important and satisfying in reaching out to masses through education programs!!!"
